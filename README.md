## Game description
- The king's palace has rooms with square shaped floors that consist of black and white tiles only.
- Light bulbs can only be placed above white tiles.
- The light from the light bulbs does not spread diagonally, only straight along the given row and column.
- The black tiles have objects placed on them, which block the propagation of light.
- Black cells can optionally contain an integer from 0 to 4. This indicates how many adjacent (bottom, top, right, left) cells contain light bulbs. If there is such a number, the puzzle must be solved accordingly!
- Two light bulbs can NEVER illuminate each other!
- The goal of the game is to place the light bulbs so that all the white tiles are illuminated.
- The game is played by one player until he solves the puzzle, so there is no need to manage multiple players at the same time or divide into rounds.
